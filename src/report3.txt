 Buggar i Dates:

    Input: 13 3 6 5
    Output: -The difference in days between 13/3 and 6/5 is:
            -397
    Expected output: Exception should be thrown
    Month 13 does not exist. An exception should be thrown, but instead, we get a negative result.

    Output: -The difference in days between 12/31 and 1/1 is:

    The program does not treat the latter date as occuring the following year,
    instead it return a negative value that also exceeds the total amount of days in a year.

    Output: The difference in days between 1/22 and 1/24 is:
            -29
