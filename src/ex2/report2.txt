public void setRequiredNumber(int nemployee, int starttime, int endtime) { ... }

requires:

ensures:

          then
             requiredNumber is set to nemployee and workingEmployees
             keeps a number of employees equal to nemployee, discarding
             the rest
          otherwise
             requiredNumber is set to nemployee and workingEmployees is unchanged
      and the rest of the schedule is unchanged


  Input space:
        nemployee => 0
        starttime => 0
        endtime => 0

  Partition:
        starttime <= endtime
        starttime > endtime
        workingEmployees.lenght() > nemployee
        workingEmployees.lenght() <= nemployee

  Block #1: starttime <= endtime
    setRequiredNumberTest_StartEqualToEnd():
            input: nemployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 0
            expected: hours 0 have requiredNumber == 2.

    setRequiredNumberTest_StartLessOrEqualToEnd():
            input: nemployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 2
            expected: hours 0,1,2 have requiredNumber set to 2
                      hours 3,4,5 have requiredNumber set to 0.(unchanged).

  Block #2: startime > endtime
    setRequiredNumberTest_StartBiggerThanEnd():
            input: nemeployee = 2, starttime = 4, endttime = 1
            expected: requiredNumber == 0, (unchanged since starttime > endtime).

        setRequiredNumberTest_NemployeeSmallerThanWorkingEmployees():
                input: 1. (nemeployee = 3, starttime = 0, endtime = 3)
                       2. then add three employees

                expected: requiredNumber == 2 && workingEmployees.lenght() == 2.

                     3. (nemployee = 3, starttime = 0, endtime = 3)
              expected: requiredNumber == 3 && workingEmployees.length() == 2. (since we didnt add any workers)

  Border cases:
    setRequiredNumberTest_NemployeeZero():
              input: nememployee = 0, starttime = 0, endtime = 3.
              expected: requiredNumber = 0, workingEmplyees = 0 (trims the list of emplyees as it should)

  Found bugs:
    setRequiredNumberTest_NemployeeSmallerThanWorkingEmployees():
    When setting requiredNumber = 3 then adding 3 employees followed by setting requiredNumber = 2
    doesn't trim the list of workers as it should.

public int nextIncomplete(int currenttime) { ... }

requires:
  currenttime >= 0 and currenttime < size

ensures:
  if there is an hour in the interval currenttime to size - 1 such that
     the length of workingEmployees is less that requiredNumber
  then
    returns the time of the hour closest to currenttime such that
    the length of workingEmployees is less that requiredNumber
  otherwise
    returns -1
  and in either case the schedule is unchanged

Input space:
    0 <= currenttime < size

Partition:

    currenttime == 0 && workingEmployees >= requiredEmployees.
    currenttime == 0 && requiredEmployees == 0.
    0 < currenttime < size && workingEmployees < requiredEmployees.
    0 < currenttime < size && workingEmployees >= requiredEmployees.

    currenttime > size
    currenttime < 0

Block #1: currenttime == 0 && workingEmployees >= requiredEmployees

    input: 1. size = 7
           2. setRequiredNumber (nemeployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 5)
           3. addWorkingPeriod("kevin", 0, 5);
           3. addWorkingPeriod("alice", 0, 5);
           4. currenttime = 0.
    expected: -1, since all hours are filled.

Block #2: currenttime == 0 && requiredEmployees == 0.
    nextIncompleteNoRequiredWorkers():
    input: 1. size = 7
           2. currenttime = 0.
    expected: -1, since we never set requiredWorkeers.

Block #3: 0 < currenttime < size && workingEmployees < requiredEmployees.
    nextIncomplete_NotAllHoursFilled():
        input: 1. size = 7
               2. setRequiredNumber (nemeployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 5)
               3. addWorkingPeriod("kevin", 0, 2);
               3. addWorkingPeriod("alice", 0, 5);
               4. currenttime = 0.
        expected: 3, since only 1 person works after hour 2. (Bug here check bug report)

    nextIncompleteNoAddedWorkers():


Block #4: 0 < currenttime < size && workingEmployees > requiredEmployees.
    nextIncompleteAllHoursFilledAndCurrentTimeWithinValidRange():
        input: 1. size = 7
               2. setRequiredNumber (nemeployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 5)

               4. currenttime = 2.
        expected: -1, since all hours are filled.

Border cases:
currenttime > size
    nextIncompleteTest_CurrentTimeBiggerThanTotalHours():
    input: 1. size = 7
           2. setRequiredNumber (nemeployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 5)

           3. addWorkingPeriod("alice", 0, 5);
           4. currenttime = 11.
    expected: -1, since hour 11 isn't part of the schedule.

currenttime < 0
    nextIncompleteTest_CurrentTimeLessThanZero():
    input: 1. size = 7
           2. setRequiredNumber (nemeployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 5)

           3. addWorkingPeriod("alice", 0, 5);
           4. currenttime = -1.
    expected: -1, since schedule can't have negative hours.

Found bugs:
    nextIncompleteTest_CurrentTimeLessThanZero():
        Should still return -1 since passing in -1 in nextIncomplete should not throw and arrayOutOfBounds
        eception and crash the program.

    nextIncomplete_NotAllHoursFilled()
        Should return 3, which is the closest hour but returns last hour.

    nextIncompleteNoAddedWorkers():
        Should return the closest hour that is not complete which is 0 but returns last hour.
